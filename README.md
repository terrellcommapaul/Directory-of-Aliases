# Directory-of-Aliases
Zsh script to create a directory full of aliases to applications. 

The thought process behind this utility script was the desire to simplify the dock experience for iMac labs environments.

In the past we would configure user docks with a selection of a larger family of applications, (Adobe Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, etc.), but that will often results in docks with 20+ items and then students would often need to applications that were not on the dock anyway.  

With this script, you can type the names of however many applications into Line 8 and have an Alias created for all of them in a Directory inside /Applications whose name you specify in Line 11.  

This script would not be possible without the help of many wonderful folks in the MacAdmins Slack #Scripting community.
